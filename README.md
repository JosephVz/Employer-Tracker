# Employer-Tracker

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation to build this was to link these two applications together, VsCode and MySQL. I Wanted to learn how to use a database in order to store useful information to employers. With more progress in learning this tool, it could trully be something very useful in a work environment.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built this project to showcase what i've learned this past week. This is my first assignment involving MySQL and I wanted to show i have the ability to link my code to MySQL and keep track of data stored in a table.

- What problem does it solve?

    This solves the problem of companies having difficulty keeping track of empoloyees, positions, and much more. With this project companies can track close to virtually any information they may need and even add said information to kep track of.

- What did you learn?

    I learned how to connect VsCode to MySQL to create tables and retrieve, store, and add information pertaining to this project. This teaches me how to link a third party to use for several different possibilities, in this case an employee tracker. i've learned better how to debug something based on what the terminal says and what MySQL says to change.
